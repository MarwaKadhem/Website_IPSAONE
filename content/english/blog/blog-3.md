Satellites are collections of systems that use a lot of electronic tools and computer programs. To coordinate all this, we need a brain: the on-board computer. This is the computer core of the CubeSat. The OBC manages all the satellite's subsystems. It is both a key component and one of the most critical. We know that 50% of critical failures come from the OBC. Given this risk, we chose an off-the-shelf solution. The OBC division is therefore responsible for analysing the computer subsystems. The tasks to be performed by the computer are manifold, ranging from data analysis to telecommunication, including the management of the satellite's operating modes.
