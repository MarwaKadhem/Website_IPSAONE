The Telecommunications division is responsible for analysing transmission systems and usable protocols. At the same time, it must ensure the agreement of the various national and international authorities concerning the frequencies used.

#### Requirements
As with any space mission, we must ensure that we maintain a link between the CubeSat and the Earth. To do this, we need to study the various telecommunications solutions for a link with a sufficient throughput. Our CubeSat, because of the systems it carries, will generate a certain amount of data to be transmitted to the teams for analysis. In addition, the installation of a camera in the CubeSat implies a certain requirement in terms of throughput. We also have to deal with the sending of commands and the security of these commands.

#### Availability
In order to provide a common base for our student members of the association, the telecommunication team has to pass the *Amateur Services Operator Certificate* (HAREC) exam. This diploma, in addition to the technical skills it certifies, allows us to transmit in the amateur radio bands: a very useful right to carry out transmission tests freely. In the perspective of democratisation of space, we have given ourselves the mission to make ARAGOSAT-1 available to radio amateurs worldwide!
