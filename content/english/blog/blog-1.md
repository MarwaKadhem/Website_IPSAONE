In an interview for the Spanish magazine Publico, Jordi Puig-Suari, professor at California Polytechnic State University but mostly co-director of the team that created the first CubeSat, confessed : “at first some people thought that our nanosatellite was a toy”. If it is quite true that one can be mistaken by this simple but eccentric idea, which is to build a satellite made up of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm cubic units, it is genuinely becoming a centre of interest for most of the scientists and space lovers. Over one thousand CubeSats were launched since the innovation of the Californian
students and teachers in 2003, showing us not only that CubeSats are not to be considered as toys anymore, but also that their potential is evident.<br>

The Nanosatellite database lists almost 2 000 CubeSats that have been launched since 1998. The total count of CubeSats launched has increased a lot since 2003. According to the [Nanosats database](https://www.nanosats.eu/), 1027 CubeSats were floating above the Earth after a successful launch in the year 2018.


#### What is exactly a CubeSat?

To put it in a nutshell, a CubeSat is a nano-satellite, a tiny cube full of nano-technologies, which is going to be more and more important in the future of space exploration from Mars missions to the surveillance of asteroids... We will explain to you how it works in details later but for the moment here is what you need to know: CubeSats open up a whole world of possibilities for those who want to explore space. Their potential is being seized upon by everyone from big agencies to small groups of students. A one unit cube CubeSat can fit in the palm of your hand and weighs between 1 and 10 kilograms. They are low cost because it’s largely based on existing electronic components. CubeSats deliver into orbit a high concentration of nano-technologies that you can even build using a 3D printer. The idea behind this innovation is simple: making space more accessible and opening challenges to anyone curious to discover the universe.

#### Why building CubeSats instead of regular satellites?

These are the many operational reasons why CubeSats are more practical than regular satellites, however, that’ll also depend on what are the missions’ objectives. It is necessary to specify that CubeSats and regular satellites have very different purposes.

##### Much lighter
As we’ve seen before, CubeSats are much smaller than regular satellites and therefore
much lighter. As a comparison, a large satellite such as RADARSAT-2 weighs more
than a ton and can be compared to a rhinoceros regarding its size whereas a CubeSat
weighs about a kilogram per unit and is the size of a duck, which is obviously much
smaller than a rhinoceros. Thanks to this comparison, provided to us by the Canadian
Space Agency, we can already say that one of the most important reasons that motivates
us to use CubeSats instead of satellites are size and weight, which allow to save on
launch costs. However, there are many more useful reasons to support that idea.

##### What about lifespan?
One important aspect to consider when launching a satellite is its lifespan. There’s
no point in using a certain type of satellite for a mission if the satellite’s equipments
are not fit to last for the duration of the mission. Unfortunately, CubeSats are not a
good fit for missions longer than a year as their lifespan is usually between three and
twelve months while the average lifespan for a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite is five
years and eight for a geosynchronous satellite. While CubeSats are not made for long
missions, they’re very useful for shorter missions with a smaller budget.

##### Time efficiency...
Another important aspect is the time required to design, test and build the satellite.
Studies conducted in the United States show that the average duration from the authorization to proceed (ATP) to the launch date is of about seven and a half years, ranging
from a low of three and a half years to fourteen and a half. Regarding CubeSats, the
Canadian Space Agency states that CubeSats can be built within two years, allowing
missions to start faster than with a regular satellite.

##### Easier to design?
One other major difference between CubeSats and regular satellites is the design requirements they both need. As we said before, CubeSats are made to remain in space for a shorter time than a regular satellite, therefore, they are less exposed to space’s extreme conditions where temperatures range from hundreds of degrees below freezing to hundreds of degrees above. A shorter exposure to these temperatures means a smaller need to protect the CubeSat. Therefore, there is no need to consider thermal blankets while designing the satellite, which allows for a more flexible design with less
restrictions, making it cheaper.

##### A solution to space debris?
Moreover, CubeSats allow us to partly solve a growing issue regarding space exploration. More and more satellites end up abandoned in space making it extremely crowded. Every time a new satellite is launched and set into a LEO, the risks of a
collision increase. And while we have yet to find a viable solution to this issue, CubeSats provide us with a partial one. First, they are smaller and while launching one increases the risks of a collision, it doesn’t increase it as much as a regular satellite would. Moreover, thanks to their light weight, CubeSats fall back into the atmosphere
at the end of their mission and burn into it upon re-entry. While CubeSats are not a definitive solution to space debris, they definitely help preventing the situation from getting worse.

##### Much more accessible...
Finally, CubeSats are imagined to be made with much simpler equipments than regular
satellite, with parts available off-the-shelf. This reduces the costs and makes CubeSats
available to a very wide array of individuals. It obviously isn’t possible for everybody
to build a regular satellite while a CubeSat is much more accessible.

#### Replacing regular satellites?
While one could assume CubeSats aim to replace regular satellites, we want to stress the fact that it
is currently not the case. They’re still an experimental tool that has its limitations, that regular satellites
do not have. They are currently more used as benchmarks for new nano-technologies. While they are
smaller, lighter, cheaper and quicker to build and launch, they also have a very short lifespan compared
to regular satellites and they are not able to do as much as a regular satellite. It
might one day be the case, but for now, CubeSats are a whole kind of satellites, amongst many others.
