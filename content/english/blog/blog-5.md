Most of the electronic equipment on board the CubeSat is designed to operate in a very low temperature range. We now know that a large number of materials are not immune to thermal distortion. This is why a thermal control solution for the satellite is essential. The TCS division is therefore responsible for the thermal analysis of the CubeSat. This is a process that is constantly evolving.
