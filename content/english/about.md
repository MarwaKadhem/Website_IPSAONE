IPSA ONE (*Orbital Nano Experiments*) is a space engineering association formed by approximately 60 students supported by 3 Phd. professors from the Polytechnic Institute of Advanced Sciences near Paris, France. We are all united by a common passion: space.<br>

Our mission, called ARAGO, is to develop a nanosatellite in the CubeSat standard:
- ARAGOSAT-1 is a 3U CubeSat whose payload is a Helicon plasma thruster. This propulsion method has never been used for space applications before. 
- The scientific objective of the mission is to miniaturise and standardise a Helicon plasma thruster to compensate atmospheric drag caused by residual air molecules at Low Earth Orbit (LEO). 
- Named NOO, this thruster, which is being designed and manufactured in collaboration with the ICARE-CNRS laboratory in Orl√©ans, France, would greatly reduce fuel consumption and thus increase the lifespan of CubeSats in LEO.

IPSA ONE was born out of a challenge we set ourselves 5 years ago: to send our own nanosatellite into space. This is a long-term project, especially as we want the project to be designed entirely by and for students! By developing our project in Open Source, we are part of a spirit of democratisation of space. In pure autonomy, our team works every day to make this mission a reality. From funding to the design of the propulsion system, we cover all aspects of this space adventure which has only just begun!
