The *Administration Network for Nanosat Association* (ANNA) is a software developed by our team. It gathers under a web interface the different tools that the association uses to organise itself, such as online storage, management of different events, missions and tasks to be carried out... Each member has an account allowing him/her to access all these tools from anywhere and thus to keep up to date with what needs to be done and the progress of projects.


#### Access restrictions and management

ANNA being an intranet, the sign-up procedure is not open to anyone. You will have to ask your mission leader to sign you up and, then, you will receive a confirmation email with your username and temporary password (that you must change in your personal space as soon as possible). ANNA has been developped with the greatest care for security, and as a result your passwords are stored securely, hashed with the industry-standard bcrypt algorithm. Even in case of data leak, cracking your password is very-near-impossible if your password is strong. In case you forgot your password, your mission leader can reassign you a temporary password that you will be able to change on your profile page.

#### Features

1. **Missions** <br>
A mission regroups some users on a common dashboard where the tasks and budget can be followed. Your team leader will keep it up to date and you will be able to follow the progress towards the missions goals on this page.

2. **Events** <br>
Events organized within the association are shared on this platform, you will be able to join the events and see their details here. Please feel free to participate.

3. **Drive** <br>
File sharing is done on the Drive page. Files have different permissions for different groups, as shown in the following screenshot. The existing permissions are read and write, and they can be assigned to everyone, the group and the file owner. The administrators can assign you to the groups you belong. That ensures that, if you wish, the files you shared can only be seen by your group members, in order to keep private information private. Files are assigned a serial number, which is associated with a barcode. The drive "search" feature lets you find the file you need, using its serial number or name! An update that is soon to come will also let you find a file by simply scanning its barcode.

#### Future updates
In the future, ANNA will be capable of handling much more. File preview and in-browser file edition are on the list, as well as adding project management capabilities and seasonal theme changes. Integration with the different branches of the association is also planned... For instance, be prepared to have a nice live satellite control panel that integrates with the ground station and the telecommunication system! Embedding concurrent-engineering tools for the future satellite developments are also a feature we would like to add on the long-term.
