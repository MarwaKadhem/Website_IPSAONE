The ARAGO mission consists of the launch of a 3U CubeSat-type propelled nanosatellite, named ARAGOSAT-1. The scientific objective of the mission is to demonstrate the functioning of a Helicon plasma thruster for space applications. The challenge of the mission lies in both the space qualification and the miniaturisation of the Helicon technology. This thruster, which we have called NOO, would make it possible to increase the lifespan of nanosatellites in low earth orbit (LEO) while guaranteeing reduced consumption compared to the technologies currently used (cold gas, liquid propellant etc.). Our simulations indicate that a 6-months mission could be extended to 3 years with such a propulsion system.

#### Launch and deployment
Like most CubeSats ARAGOSAT-1 will either be launched :
- as a secondary payload for conventional launchers (Soyuz, Ariane 5, Atlas V etc.). 90% of CubeSats 
are launched in this way. CubeSats are installed on board a deployer, called P-POD (*Poly-Picosatellite
Orbital Deployer*), which is mounted on the upper stage of the launcher. The P-POD acts as an interface between the 
launcher and the CubeSat. The launcher sends an electrical signal to the P-POD which triggers the opening of the door 
and ejects the CubeSat thanks to multiple strings.
- from the International Space Station, after embarkation in a supply ship. 

Via the European Space Agency's **Fly Your Satellite!** program.
