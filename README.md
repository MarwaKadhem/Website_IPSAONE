# A Website for the student association Orbital Nano Experiments (IPSA ONE) | by Marwa Kadhem

As part of the course "computer technologies in telecommunications" (RAE473), this paper, corresponding to our final project on modern web-development, aims to present the methodology used to achieve a complete website. Regarding the content of the website, rather than building a personal portfolio, I decided to give this project a purpose by building instead a website for an association, called Orbital Nano Experiments (IPSA ONE), that I have been involved in since the beginning of my bachelorâ€™s degree. The goal of this space engineering association is to design a nano-satellite to demonstrate the functioning a Helicon plasma thruster to compensate atmospheric drag. More information will be available on the website that will be created to show achievements and promote the association.

... More details in the Course project paper.

This repository gathers all the code for the HUGO & JAMstack website (go language) of the association IPSA ONE.
